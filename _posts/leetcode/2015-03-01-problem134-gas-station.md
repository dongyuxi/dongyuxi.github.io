<pre><code>/**
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
 * station i is gas[i].
 * 
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to
 * travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with
 * an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 * 
 * Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit
 * once, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * Note: The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
