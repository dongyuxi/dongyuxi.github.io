<pre><code>/**
 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
 * 
 * For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as
 * 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as
 * 00111001011110000010100101000000).
 * 
 * Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
